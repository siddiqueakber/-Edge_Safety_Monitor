## 🔄 Task 2: Setup Virtual Environment

**STATUS: READY TO START** 🚀

### Windows Quick Start:
```bash
# Run the automated setup script
quick_start.bat
```

### Manual Setup (Windows):
```bash
# 1. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# 2. Activate it
venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Manual Setup (Linux/Mac):
```bash
# 1. Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# 2. Activate it
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Expected Time:** 10 minutes  
**Success Indicator:** No errors during pip install

---

## 🗂️ Task 3: Gather Datasets + Sample Images

**STATUS: READY TO START** 📊

### Step 3.1: Download Datasets Script
```bash
# Make sure venv is activated
python scripts/download_datasets.py
```

This will show you instructions for downloading datasets from:
1. **Roboflow** - Hard hat, safety vest datasets
2. **Kaggle** - Phone usage, drowsiness datasets

### Step 3.2: Create Accounts

**Roboflow (Free):**
- Go to: https://roboflow.com/
- Sign up for free account
- Get API key from workspace settings

**Kaggle (Free):**
- Go to: https://www.kaggle.com/
- Sign up for free account
- Get API key: Account → Create New API Token

### Step 3.3: Download Datasets

**Option A: Use Roboflow Web Interface**
1. Browse: https://universe.roboflow.com/
2. Search: "hard hat detection"
3. Download in YOLOv8 format
4. Extract to: `data/raw/helmet/`

**Option B: Quick Start (Small Dataset)**
For testing, collect 20-30 sample images:
- Google: "construction worker with helmet" → Save 10 images
- Google: "worker without helmet" → Save 10 images
- Place in: `data/raw/helmet/images/`

Repeat for vest, phone, drowsiness categories.

**Expected Time:** 30-60 minutes (varies with download speed)

---

## ✅ Task 4: Run YOLOv8 Baseline

**STATUS: READY TO START** 🧪

### Run the Baseline Test:
```bash
# Make sure venv is activated
python scripts/test_baseline.py
```

### What It Does:
- ✓ Checks Python, PyTorch, CUDA, OpenCV
- ✓ Downloads YOLOv8 model (first run only)
- ✓ Runs sample inference
- ✓ Saves results to `outputs/baseline_test/`

### Expected Output:
```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║          Edge Safety Monitor - Baseline Test            ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

🔍 Environment Check
✓ Python Version: 3.x.x
✓ PyTorch Version: 2.x.x
✓ OpenCV Version: 4.x.x

🚀 Testing YOLOv8 Detection
✓ Model loaded successfully!
✓ Inference completed!

✅ YOLOv8 Baseline Test PASSED!
```

**Expected Time:** 5 minutes (first run downloads model)  
**Success Indicator:** "YOLOv8 Baseline Test PASSED!"
